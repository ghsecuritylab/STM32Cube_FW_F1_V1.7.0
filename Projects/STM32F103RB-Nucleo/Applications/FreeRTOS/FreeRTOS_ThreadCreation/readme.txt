@par Description

How to implement thread creation using CMSIS RTOS API. 

Thread 1 toggles LED2 every 250 milliseconds for 5 seconds then resumes Thread 2
and suspends itself. Thread 2 resumes and toggles LED2 every 500 milliseconds
for 10 seconds, then Thread 2 resumes Thread 1 and suspends itself.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F1xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F103RB-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
